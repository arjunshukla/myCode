The gains came a day after it closed below 18,000- mark at 17,905.91 points-- the lowest in 11 months.\n\t\tThe wider 50-scrip Nifty of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) closed the day's trade 105.90 points or two percent up at 5,408.45 points.\n\n\t\t\"A deep oversold Indian equities and uptick in the European bourses provided the uplift to Indian stocks, which has clocked gains of two percent on the broad indices,\" said Anindya Banerjee, analyst, Kotak Securities.\n\n\t\t\"Expectation that government could lift ban on mining propped the banking shares upward. The weakness in the rupee, which touched a fresh life time low against the 65.56 did not have much impact on the equity markets, beyond intra-day volatility.\"\n\n\t\tThe turnaround in the markets came despite rupee breaching the psychological resistance level of 65 against a dollar. This was the new record low for the rupee, and a consecutive sixth straight fall in a row session, after the US Federal Reserve hinted it would start scaling back stimulus as early as next month.\n\n\t\tThe partially-convertible rupee slumped by 2.2 percent to hit a new record low of 65.56 against a dollar at the inter-bank foreign exchange market here, surpassing its previous record low of 64.54 touched Wednesday.

            news = @"AT THE end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan it is traditional for Indonesians to ask one another for forgiveness. Rudi Rubiandini, chairman until last week of the country's oil-and-gas regulator, must be hoping for some seasonal clemency. On August 13th the anti-corruption commission, the KPK, arrested Mr Rubiandini after catching him pocketing $400,000 from a Singaporean energy firm, Kernel Oil. The money is allegedly the second instalment of a bribe worth $700,000. Mr Rubiandini has admitted accepting gifts but denies corruption, as does Kernel Oil.\n\n\t\tAnother scandal is the last thing the country's beleaguered energy industry needs. Last November the Constitutional Court dissolved the previous regulator. Many interpreted this as evidence of creeping economic nationalism in Indonesia. The court sided with a group of petitioners who claimed that the 2001 oil-and-gas law which established the regulator was in violation of the constitution. This insists that natural resources remain under \"the powers of the state\". Within days the government established a new regulator, now called SKK Migas.\n\n\t\tWhereas its predecessor was an independent watchdog, SKK Migas sits under the energy ministry. That may make it more prone to corruption, says Kevin O'Rourke, a political-risk consultant. After Mr Rubiandini's arrest, the KPK searched the offices of the ministry's top bureaucrat, where it seized another $200,000 as part of the widening investigation. The energy minister, Jero Wacik, is a senior member of the Democratic Party of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. Mr Wacik denies any involvement by his party, and Mr Rubiandini himself has said that the money from Kernel Oil was not meant for the minister. Still, the scandal has raised questions about party financing ahead of elections due next year.\n\n\t\tIndonesia's oil industry has been in decline for decades, with crude-oil production almost halving since the mid-1990s. The country's proven reserves of 4 billion barrels are likely to be sucked dry by the mid-2020s. A dozen foreign oil-exploration firms have spent nearly $2 billion between them drilling for new reserves in the past five years, but have found nothing much. Meanwhile, Indonesia is struggling to attract investors to tap undersea reserves in the east of the archipelago that are hard to get at.\n\n\t\tScandals such as the latest one will not help boost the industry. Mr Yudhoyono suspended Mr Rubiandini on August 14th, less than eight months after the regulator took up his post. Officials stress that Kernel Oil, a subsidiary of a parent company registered in the British Virgin Islands, is involved in neither oil exploration nor production in Indonesia. Rather, it is one of 40-odd firms licensed to bid for petroleum products not used by Pertamina, the state-owned oil firm. Still, these attempts at reassurance may not be enough for investors. It is the first time that the KPK has properly investigated the oil-and-gas business, worth almost $70 billion annually. More revelations are likely as the probe continues.";

            news = @"Investment in the UK oil and gas industry reached an all-time record of £13.5 billion this year, in part due to the Government and industry's recently renewed commitment to maximising return from the UK's Continental Shelf (UKCS), according to an industry survey.\n\n\t\tHowever, Oil and Gas UK's 2013 Economic Report (76-page / 7.6MB PDF) also showed that output from the UKCS was continuing to fall. The industry body has revised down its production estimates for this year to 1.2 ñ 1.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) from its previous estimate of 1.45 - 1.5m boepd. Annual production fell 14.5% in 2012, to 1.54m boepd, it said.\n\n\t\tOil and Gas UK chief executive Malcolm Webb said that this decline was due in part to aging infrastructure, and that continued investment would be needed to lift output back to a production target of 2m boepd.\n\n\t\t\"Despite impressive investment in new developments, the production efficiency of existing assets remains in worrying decline,\" he said. \"DECC [the Department of Energy and Climate Change] and the industry are working to tackle this serious concern through a joint task group. The Wood Review, which is currently examining how to maximise UKCS recovery, is also very timely and we very much look forward to seeing the recommendations early in 2014.\"\n\n\t\t\"The industrial strategies launched by both the British and Scottish governments provide a clear framework for increased investment, innovation, growth in exports and British job creation. Unlocking the total economic potential of the UKCS will require both the industry and government to play their respective parts to the full,\" he said. According to the report, the UK oil and gas industry currently supports around 450,000 jobs and generates almost £40 billion a year for the UK economy, including £7bn through the export of oilfield technology and expertise to other countries. The UK supply chain generates sales of £27bn a year, of which £7bn is in exports.\n\t\tOil and gas extraction is also a significant source of tax revenue for the Treasury, according to the report. Production taxes amounted to £6.5bn, or over 15% of total corporate tax receipts, in 2012-13, and the supply chain accounted for an additional £5bn in corporate and payroll taxes, according to the report.\n\t\tThe UK Government has previously said that although the UKCS is past \"peak production\", at least 20bn more barrels of oil equivalent (boe) could still be produced. It has estimated that oil and gas will continue to provide up to 70% of the UK's primary energy supplies in 2030. It has proposed or introduced incentives to boost investment including the introduction of Decommissioning Relief Deeds, to give businesses certainty over the tax relief that they will receive when decommissioning their assets; and new allowances for operators in small fields, large shallow-water gas fields, older 'brownfield' sites and certain unexplored fields in the north west of Scotland.\n\n\t\tAccording to Oil and Gas UK, 15 new fields with combined reserves of 470 million boe will come onstream this year. However, overall production is expected to continue to fall until 2015, when the current high level of investment will begin to have an impact on production.\n\t\tCommenting on the figures, oil and gas expert Bob Ruddiman of Pinsent Masons, the law firm behind Out-Law.com, said that the industry was \"capital intensive\", and that investments needed to be made \"for the medium to long term\". \"Although we are seeing record levels of investment, it will take some time for this to filter into the oil and gas sector,\" he said.\n\n\t\tRuddiman instead highlighted Oil and Gas UK's findings of rising production costs as a particular area of concern. The cost of producing a barrel of oil has risen fourfold over the past decade, according to the report, and varies widely for individual fields. Although it costs on average £13.50 to recover the equivalent of one barrel of oil, several fields now cost more than £40/boe to operate, it said.\n\t\t\"Industry needs to look urgently at how it manages costs,\" Ruddiman said. \"The Government cannot influence this, but it is essential that collaborative work between the industry and Government continues if the industry is to maximise the recovery of the UK's remaining oil and gas supplies.\"";

            news = @"Don Feusner ran dairy cattle on his 370-acre slice of northern Pennsylvania until he could no longer turn a profit by farming. Then, at age 60, he sold all but a few Angus and aimed for a comfortable retirement on money from drilling his land for natural gas instead.\n\n\t\tIt seemed promising. Two wells drilled on his lease hit as sweet a spot as the Marcellus shale could offer ñ tens of millions of cubic feet of natural gas gushed forth. Last December, he received a check for $8,506 for a month's share of the gas.            Then one day in April, Feusner ripped open his royalty envelope to find that while his wells were still producing the same amount of gas, the gusher of cash had slowed. His eyes cascaded down the page to his monthly balance at the bottom: $1,690.Chesapeake Energy, the company that drilled his wells, was withholding almost 90 percent of Feusner's share of the income to cover unspecified \"gathering\" expenses and it wasn't explaining why.\n\n\t\t\"They said you're going to be a millionaire in a couple of years, but none of that has happened,\" Feusner said. \"I guess we're expected to just take whatever they want to give us.\"\n\n\t\tLike every landowner who signs a lease agreement to allow a drilling company to take resources off his land, Feusner is owed a cut of what is produced, called a royalty.In 1982, in a landmark effort to keep people from being fleeced by the oil industry, the federal government passed a law establishing that royalty payments to landowners would be no less than 12.5 percent of the oil and gas sales from their leases.\n\n\t\tFrom Pennsylvania to North Dakota, a powerful argument for allowing extensive new drilling has been that royalty payments would enrich local landowners, lifting the economies of heartland and rural America. The boom was also supposed to fill the government's coffers, since roughly 30 percent of the nation's drilling takes place on federal land.Over the last decade, an untold number of leases were signed, and hundreds of thousands of wells have been sunk into new energy deposits across the country.But manipulation of costs and other data by oil companies is keeping billions of dollars in royalties out of the hands of private and government landholders, an investigation by ProPublica has found.\n\n\t\tAn analysis of lease agreements, government documents and thousands of pages of court records shows that such underpayments are widespread. Thousands of landowners like Feusner are receiving far less than they expected based on the sales value of gas or oil produced on their property. In some cases, they are being paid virtually nothing at all.\n\n\t\tIn many cases, lawyers and auditors who specialize in production accounting tell ProPublica energy companies are using complex accounting and business arrangements to skim profits off the sale of resources and increase the expenses charged to landowners.Deducting expenses is itself controversial and debated as unfair among landowners, but it is allowable under many leases, some of which were signed without landowners fully understanding their implications.\n\n\t\tBut some companies deduct expenses for transporting and processing natural gas, even when leases contain clauses explicitly prohibiting such deductions. In other cases, according to court files and documents obtained by ProPublica, they withhold money without explanation for other, unauthorized expenses, and without telling landowners that the money is being withheld.\n\n\t\tSignificant amounts of fuel are never sold at all ñ companies use it themselves to power equipment that processes gas, sometimes at facilities far away from the land on which it was drilled. In Oklahoma, Chesapeake deducted marketing fees from payments to a landowner ñ a joint owner in the well ñ even though the fees went to its own subsidiary, a pipeline company called Chesapeake Energy Marketing. The landowner alleged the fees had been disguised in the form of lower sales prices. A court ruled that the company was entitled to charge the fees.Costs such as these are normally only documented in private transactions between energy companies, and are almost never detailed to landowners.";

            news = @"OTTAWA - The federal government is being urged to take a hard look at rail safety in the wake of a disaster that devastated a small Quebec town this summer.A Senate report released Thursday calls on Ottawa to commission an independent review of the regulations and industry practices of the country's railways.\n\n\t\t\"Each major incident, whether in Canada or beyond our borders, must be carefully examined to learn what went wrong so that steps can be taken to prevent similar accidents in the future,\" the document says.\"This is why the committee has recommended a major arm's length review of safety in rail transportation.\"\n\n\t\tThe report comes just weeks after an oil-laden freight train jumped the tracks and exploded in the Quebec town of Lac-Megantic.\n\n\t\tThe July 6 disaster, which killed 47 people and led to a mass evacuation in the community of 6,000, has since prompted a criminal investigation and several lawsuits.\n\t\tAlthough the study began last November, Conservative Sen. Richard Neufeld said the Lac-Megantic disaster weighed on he and his colleagues on the Senate energy committee as they wrote the report.\n\n\t\t\"We were pretty well done looking at all the things we wanted to look at and were in the process of writing the report when that terrible accident happened,\" said Neufeld, chairman of the committee.\n\t\tThe explosion focused the committee on the use of rail cars and the issue of liability, he added. One of the report's 13 recommendations is that rail companies have enough insurance to cover major accidents.\n\t\tThe Senate committee also notes that Transport Canada has yet to implement all the recommendations from a December 2011 report by former environment commissioner Scott Vaughan on transporting dangerous goods by rail.\n\t\tOther recommendations relate to marine and pipeline safety. The report mentions the proposed Northern Gateway pipeline and Trans Mountain expansion project as two routes intended to carry oil to the West Coast.\n\n\t\tThe study is also being released as Calgary-based TransCanada Corp. holds consultations over its proposed west-to-east oil pipeline.\n\t\tThe $12-billion Energy East pipeline would carry western crude oil all the way to the East Coast.\n\t\tThe company plans to convert roughly 3,000 kilometres of its natural gas main line to ship oil from Alberta to Quebec and build an additional 1,400 kilometres of new pipe to Saint John, N.B.\n\n\t\tFrom there, the crude could feed Irving Oil's massive refinery and be shipped offshore.\n\t\tHowever, critics of the proposed pipeline say the potential environmental risks are too great.The Senate committee held 13 hearings and heard from 51 visits as it prepared its report.";

            news = @"The Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East has filed a controversial lawsuit seeking to extract a settlement from oil, gas and pipeline interests in compensation for the industry's long-term damage to Louisiana's fragile and rapidly collapsing coast. The administration of Gov. Bobby Jindal claims that the Flood Protection Authority lacked the authority to file the suit and wants it withdrawn on grounds that it is hostile to oil and gas interests and possibly inimical to other state efforts to secure funding for coastal restoration.\n\t\tIn recent days, author and Flood Protection Authority vice chairman John Barry has spoken in defense of the suit before a joint legislative committee and the Baton Rouge Press Club. His remarks have been edited and updated to include developments at a Wednesday meeting of the state's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, of which Barry is a member:\t\tWhat we're doing is simple: We want to save Louisiana, at least part of it.\n\n\t\tFirst, the background:\n\t\tWe are an independent board, created by a constitutional amendment, which passed after Katrina with 81 percent of the vote. The amendment envisioned a board of experts who would try to prevent another such catastrophe ó a board of experts independent of political influence.\n\n\nJohn Barry\n\n\t\tA special nominating committee was created, including deans of engineering schools in the state, representatives of engineering and scientific societies and good-government groups.\n\t\tThis committee sends nominees to the governor, who must appoint someone from the nominees, and the senate confirms.To guarantee we see the big picture, that we are not parochial, the law requires us to have four members from outside our jurisdiction.\n\t\tOur board has expertise in engineering, meteorology, coastal science, oceans and the history of the levees. From North Carolina we have the co-author of the most advanced storm-surge model in the world, from California the head of that state's flood plain management, and another board member has written textbooks used in college courses. I have the least technical training of anyone on the board, but I routinely participate in working groups at the National Academies of Science. I am the only non-scientist ever to win an honor given by the National Academies for contributions to water-related knowledge. I also serve on advisory boards at MIT's Center for Engineering Systems Fundamentals and Johns Hopkins' School of Public Health Center for Refugees and Disaster Relief.\n\n\t\t We all take our task very seriously and very personally. Two board members lost everything they owned in Katrina.  Several of us know people killed in that storm.\n\t\tJindal can be a great governor for the coast ó a great governor period ó if he steps in, brings everyone together and solves this problem.  It might make him the greatest governor in Louisiana's history.Flood protection has nothing to do with partisanship, I might add. We are a majority Republican board, including one vocal Tea Party member and at least one other member who leans that way.\n\n\t\tWith unanimous support, we filed the lawsuit seeking compensation from oil, gas and pipeline interests because we don't want other people to die in a hurricane or have their homes and livelihoods destroyed./n/n/t/tThose who created the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East wanted to insulate us from political pressure ó exactly the kind of pressure exerted on us by the governor and others in the past month.\n\t\tWe have gotten criticism from public figures but a lot of support from the public. We believe the public understands. The more people  hear what we're doing and why, the more support we have.\n\t\tThe first point I want to make is that no one has criticized the substance of our lawsuit. Let me repeat: No one has criticized the substance of our lawsuit.\n\nProblem uniquely our own\n\n\t\tLouisiana isn't like any other state. Twelve thousand square miles of Louisiana ó all the way north to the Arkansas border and our entire coast ó was formed by sediment coming from the Mississippi River.  We are not like Texas or Mississippi, and certainly not like Maine and Oregon.  We have no rocky cliffs on the coast.  We have mud held together by roots.  And that mud is melting into the ocean.\n\n\t\tOur board has never said oil, gas and pipeline companies are solely responsible for the loss of nearly 2,000 square miles of our state in the past 80 years or so. There are multiple causes.\n\t\tIt's the industry which likes to blame one cause ó the levees ó as the source of all problems, but it isn't just levees. If it was, the western part of the state wouldn't have lost any land at all. The western part of the state is outside the river's flood plain. Even if there were no levees, floodwater from the river would never reach that area. If levees were the only problem, out west they would have no land loss. Instead, they have plenty of it.\n\n\t\tIn fact, the multiple causes for land loss include levees, six dams in Montana and the Dakotas which retain almost a third of the sediment that used to flow down the river, benefits for the shipping industry, such as the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and the lethal Mississippi River Gulf Outlet ó and the oil and gas industry.\n\t\tThe fact that there are multiple causes does not mean, however, that an entity responsible for part of the destruction should not be accountable for what it has done.\n\n\t\tLet me quote something: \"Dredging canals for oil and gas pipelines took a toll on the landscape, Canals and pipelines , criss-crossed south Louisiana marshes. The coastal marshes were lost when spoil banks were left randomly throughout the area, drastically altering the natural hydrology. Saltwater intrusion increased and more land was lost. Canal dredging has had one of the most dramatic effects on wetland growth and regeneration Ö The marsh is unable to regenerate itself. [All of this amounts to] industrial negligence.\"\n\n\t\tWhat I just quoted isn't from our lawsuit. It's from the state's Master Plan for a sustainable coast.\n\t\tThe truth is the truth. Every scientist agrees that the oil and gas industry has done extraordinary damage to our coast.  Even the industry concedes it. One U.S. Geological Survey study, a study that included input from industry scientists, concluded that 36 percent of the damage statewide comes from industry. Other estimates put it much higher.\n\n\t\tIt is also a truth that the industry operated under permits which required them to minimize damage and repair it when they finished.  The industry has failed to obey these requirements.\n\n\t\tThose are the two fundamental facts which drove us to consider taking legal action. There is a third truth. Everyone on the board has wondered how we can meet our responsibilities. Our job is not simply to operate and maintain a levee system handed to us by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Our job is protecting people's lives and property.\n\n\t\tWe just conducted a study of the land bridge extending into Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans East. If that narrow spit of land disappears, the ocean will roar unchecked into the lake and threaten the lives and property of people who have never been threatened before. Reinforcing that alone would cost $1.2 billion.\n\n\t\tWe don't have that money. As we look at the tremendous expenses necessary to maintain minimally adequate protection, we see nothing coming in.\n\t\tOne of our critics is quoted as saying: \"We have a Master Plan.  Let's give it a chance.\" I absolutely agree with that statement.  Let's give it a chance.  Nothing we do is at variance with the state's Master Plan. We want to carry out the Master Plan\n\t\tLet me repeat: Nothing we're doing is inconsistent with the Master Plan. What we're doing will let us carry out the Master Plan in our area.\nHere's the problem: The Master Plan has no funding.\nOverarching duty: protecting the public\n\n\t\tThe Flood Authority board believes that for our jurisdiction we have an absolute duty to pursue this case. If we don't do it, we see no way to get the money needed to protect the public.\n\n\t\tJohn Barry's books include \"Rising Tide\" and, more recently, \"Roger Williams and the Creation of the American Soul.\" A member of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East, he also serves on the state's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority.";

That's down from 4,693 work fatalities in 2011.\n\t\tIt was a different story for the oil and gas industry, however. As domestic drilling boomed, so did workplace deaths. Fatal work injuries in oil and gas extraction industries jumped 23 percent in 2012 to 138, the highest number for that industry since BLS began keeping track in 1992.\n\n\t\tWorkplace fatalities in the construction industry increased 5 percent to 775 in 2011. This increase followed five years of declines in this sector.\n\t\t\"We can and must do better,\" said Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez. \"Job gains in oil and gas and construction have come with more fatalities, and that is unacceptable.\"\n\n\t\tThe BLS also found that 19 workers under the age of 16 were killed on the job in 2012. That's the highest number since 2005. Most of these youths were agricultural workers.\n\n\t\tTransportation-related incidents were the leading cause of workplace fatalities, followed by violence, falls, and being struck by objects or equipment.\n\n\t\tSecretary of Labor Thomas Perez said he was \"greatly encouraged\" by the overall reduction in workplace fatalities.\n\n\t\t\"It is a testament to the hard work of employers, unions, health and safety professionals and the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Mine Safety and Health Administration,\" he said. \"Through collaborative education and outreach efforts, and effective law enforcement, these numbers indicate that we are absolutely moving in the right direction.\"We will continue to engage with employers to make sure that these fatality numbers go down further,\" he said.";

        case 7:
            news = @"On June 17, British Prime Minister David Cameron made headlines around the world when he announced he would push for tougher monitoring procedures for mining, oil and gas projects in the UK ñ what is often referred to jointly as extractive industries. His announcement,  which he made from the site of the G8 summit with the riveting coastline of Loche Erne, Northern Ireland as a backdrop, came only five days after Canada's prime minister had made a similar announcement. The two press statements offered the impression that western governments were, for once, united in the need for public disclosure of the sums that are paid to governments by extractive industries.\n\n\t\tReports that companies were paying lucrative sums for mining contracts in countries with human rights violations were forcing western politicians to take a more public stand on the issue of transparency. So was the revelation that oil and gas companies were not being forced to acknowledge the potential ecological and social impact of their investments in underdeveloped nations, and that extractive measures like hydraulic fracturing were becoming more prominent globally.\n\n\t\tSo, Cameron's announcement was great news, as was Prime Minister Stephen Harper's in Canada, which according to his own disclosure is home to 70 percent of the world's mining companies.\n\n\t\tAnd so was the announcement by the European Union's parliament that it had overwhelmingly passed an update to its Accounting Directive the previous week that put more pressure on extractive and logging companies to disclose their foreign investments.\n\n\t\tThe EU's new Accounting (and Transparency) Directive laws were meant to bring them in line with U.S. legislation that had been implemented in 2012 as part of the powerful Frank-Dodd Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The federal legislation required mineral, oil and gas companies to disclose to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) all payments they made to foreign governments. In short, it required companies to reveal their investments in records that could potentially become public knowledge ñ including to the press.\nAnd that was a problem.\n\n\t\tIt's interesting that the EU chose to pattern its updates after the highly contentious U.S. legislation. While the Frank-Dodd Act has been fairly successful in consumer rights protection, it has fallen woefully short when it comes to ensuring that mining, oil and gas companies \"come clean\" about their foreign investments.\n\n\t\tSections of the act that were designed to regulate extractive industries had only been implemented by the SEC last year. Disagreements between industry and transparency stakeholders delayed enforcement of these powers by more than a year. And by the time that the EU announced its successful passage of the Accounting Directive and Cameron had held his press conference on the shores of Loche Erne, the SEC was already embroiled in a lawsuit.\n\n\t\tOn July 2, barely two weeks after the EU passed its updates to the Accounting Directive, the District Court of the District of Columbia struck down the very section of the Frank-Dodd Act that would have required the disclosure not only of payments made to foreign governments, but the identity of the host country and the investor.\n\n\t\tThe American Petroleum Institute (API), which levied the suit, argued that in some cases the companies' mining contracts prevented them from revealing the identity of the host countries. Angola, Qatar, China and Cameroon either prohibit publication of government contracts or require advance permission to do so.\n\t\tThe SEC, on the other hand, argued that that the law required public disclosure. Period.\n\n\t\tU.S. District Court Judge John D. Bates however, rejected the SEC's argument. He ordered the SEC to redraft the provisions, calling its interpretation \"arbitrary and capricious.\" The SEC, he ruled, had not followed the spirit of the law.\n\n\t\tWhie the District Court's ruling has hampered attempts by the U.S.  government to increase transparency, it hasn't halted the EU's efforts. And the slow but methodic growth of a global initiative called the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative,  in which countries voluntarily pledge transparency, shows promise as well.\n\n\t\tStill, the SEC's recent loss can't help but impact the effort to improve corporate social responsibility in developing nations.\n\t\tAs Senator Ben Cardin noted at the time of Bates' ruling, \"The U.S. has been at the forefront of the transparency fight and this decision will delay implementation of vital transparency.\n\t\tRecent admissions by Prime Minister Cameron where he says that he feels that \"UK is missing out big time,\" when it comes to not partaking in the \"fracking boom\" has unnerved environmental advocates as well. So has the news that one of Cameron's aides operates a fracking consultancy business in Australia.\n\n\t\tCameron's call for more disclosure laws and for more international partnerships is, no doubt, a boon for international relations that will benefit the U.S. But the absence of effective U.S. oversight of mining, oil and gas payments to foreign countries is still a concern when it comes to protecting human rights and the environment worldwide.";

            news = @"Reliance may skip future oil & gas auctionsCompany says policy flip-flops a reminder of pre-1991 era\n\nHit by the governmentís flip-flops on policies related to the energy sector, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), the countryís largest private sector refiner, has said it may not participate in exploration and production (E&P) ventures in India.\n\n\t\t\"With the government going back on its own policies and words in the last couple of years, with talks of price control and regulatory hurdles, we are going back to the pre-1991 era,\" said B Ganguly, president and chief operating officer (business operations, petroleum, exploration and production).\n\n\t\t\"Unless it is demonstrated that irrespective of any government, the continuation of economic and sectoral policies would be respected, no investor will have confidence. We will have to take a call on whether to invest in future E&P bid rounds in India,\" he added. He said though confidence in the countryís E&P sector was slowly improving, \"unless it improves significantly, we are not very sure we would participate in future exploration and production bid rounds.\"\n\n\t\tRIL has been facing regulatory hurdles in the case of some of its E&P assets. The company, which has seen a steady decline in production from its KG-D6 blockís D1 and D3 fields, has been seeking market price for gas. This June, despite opposition, including that from within the Cabinet, the government approved doubling of natural gas prices from the present $4.2 a million British thermal unit (mBtu) to $8.4 an mBtu from April 1 2014.\n\n\t\tRIL has said all talk on the gas price revision recommended by the Rangarajan committee benefiting RIL was baseless.\n\t\tIn a letter to parliamentary standing committee on finance Chairman Yashwant Sinha,Executive Director P M S Prasad said, \"The bulk of the gas ó 70 per cent ó is produced by public sector companies such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Oil India. RILís KG D6 block has a mere 15 per cent share in the total domestic production in India.\"\n\n\t\tHe said with RIL holding only 60 per cent interest in the KG-D6 block, its share in domestic production was less than 10 per cent, adding further incremental gas production from KG-D6 was unlikely before 2018. \"Geological surprises have led to a decline in production from the D1 and D3 fields. With new data emerging from four years of production, it is now clear not much additional gas can be produced from this field.\n\n\t\tRIL said the cost-plus regime for gas pricing wasnít only against the contractual commitment of the government under the production-sharing contract, but also of little economic and commercial relevance. This was because the E&P sector has a low probability of success and faces geological risks.\n\n\t\tRIL argues it didnít invest in the D1 and D3 fields of the KG-D6 block alone. \"We invested in the exploration and production business. We have not even recovered our investments in KG-D6,\" Ganguly said. So far, RILís total investment stands at $22 billion. It is planning to invest more in a couple of projects awaiting government approvals.\n\n\t\t\"When we entered the business, we were willing to assume geological risks. Both the commodity price and the capital cost being market-related risks, we would have had a reasonable hedge between the two risks. But now, with a poor regulatory record and commodity price control, all the four risks have come to the investor,\" said Ganguly.\n\n\t\t\"All we have been asking the government is to give us the regime that existed when we entered this business. When the government controls the commodity price but cannot control the capital cost as it is market related, investors will be on a shaky ground and would not like to invest in such high risk business,\" he added.";
